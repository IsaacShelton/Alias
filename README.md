# Alias IM Client

**NOTE:** This is code inside **Alias\app\src\main**. There is private information in higher up directories and I don't want to have to sort through all of it.

**This code is pretty bad and unorganized.** I threw it together in a few days and didn't intend on ever sharing it. However, it is. Make sure you have some bleach along to cleanse your eyes after you see what you're about to see.

**EXTERNAL COMMUNICATION**
- Notifications are distributed through a PHP script on my web server
- Messages and chatrooms are stored in a real-time database
